## Greenhouse Monitor
ESP32 based web monitoring of conditions via HTU21D temperature/humidity sensing and a simple LDR photoresistor.

### Bill of Materials
* [ESP32 Development Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3269)
* [SSD1306 128x64 OLED Display](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072Q2X2LL)
* [HTU21D Temp/Humidity Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1899) and/or [BME280 Temp/Humidity/Pressure Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2652)
* [Photocell](https://www.adafruit.com/product/161)
* [10k Resistor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2784)

### Wiring/Construction
* TODO

### Software/Firmware Installation
* TODO

### TODO:
* Finish this write-up
* Include BME280 based sensing as an option (more accurate?)
* Continue long term testing (memory leaks/failure modes?)
* Smart home integration?  Twitter?
